# Translator
OCR Translator

This program searches for Japanese text in the active window and converts that text to a string. 
This string is then passed through the DeepL API and is translated into english.
That transalation is then printed onto the application window. 

better GUI and add support for a dark and light theme.


**Example:**

**Future Changes:**

- Have the application clear and reprint the translation if the image displayed on the active window changes. 
- Add support for different languages.
- Improve the time it takes for the application to translate and output the text to the screen. (currently this takes about 5 - 10 seconds).
- Improve translation accuracy by implementing ML technologies to better recognize and interpret slang and onomatopoeia.
